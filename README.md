# About this blog

This blog is made for sharing my views and knowledge in a way that can help others.
I intend to maintain and update the posts so their content will continue to be relevant as things change.

Each post has a history (since it's a git repository) so if you read a certain version of it and just want to know what is new, you can just look at a diff (TODO: Link to a quick guide).
